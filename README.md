# SF Library
This project proposes an extended Social Force based multi-agent pedestrian model implementation.


### ...a bit of theory
The component of the model that administers the locomotion of pedestrians includes
  - acceleration term which describes pedestrianâ€™s tendency to go to desired location, this force is pointing towards that location
  - repulsive effect of other pedestrians
  - repulsive effect of borders
  - attractive effect increasing with time
  - gravity effect
